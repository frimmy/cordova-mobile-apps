===================

Experimentation with Ionic, an Angular + Cordova framework for mobile app development w/ JS, CSS, HTML; delish

I started experimenting with apache cordova because of it's potential for 
native app development w/o knowing obj-c/java. 

This is the grim story

1. Downloaded cordova + Apache Ant (already had android sdk)
2. Using tutorial @ http://www.sitepoint.com/building-simple-app-using-ionic-advanced-html5-mobile-app-framework/?utm_source=html5weekly&utm_medium=email(clean up link in the future)
I decided to first build the sample cordova getting started hello world app (hello dir). 
3. TODO: complete the ionic tut
