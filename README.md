===================

Experimentation with Ionic, an Angular + Cordova framework for mobile app development w/ JS, CSS, HTML; delish

I started experimenting with apache cordova because of it's potential for 
native app development w/o knowing obj-c/java. 

This is the grim story

1. Downloaded cordova + Apache Ant (already had android sdk)
2. Using tutorial @ http://www.sitepoint.com/building-simple-app-using-ionic-advanced-html5-mobile-app-framework/?utm_source=html5weekly&utm_medium=email(clean up link in the future)
I decided to first build the sample cordova getting started hello world app (hello dir). 
3. TODO: complete the ionic tut
[edit: Finished as of 4:20 am 5/15/2014]
4. After toiling for hours(likely just 1 tops), figured out my js file was incorrectly referrenced. Updated, went through tutorial (which much is also fcovered here http://ionicframework.com/docs/guide/
  # Covers everything from what ionic is, to testing, to even publishing on respective app stores.

Downside: you need to kinda know how angular works; by going through several of these tuts, tho, you'll learn both!
So basically, do yourself a favor, and learn this stuff.
